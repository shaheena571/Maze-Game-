The Maze Escape Game is a Python project that demonstrates the working of the Backtracking algorithm through an interactive Tkinter interface.
It simulates how a player (rat) finds a way out of a maze by exploring possible paths and backtracking from dead ends.
The visualization highlights the process using color-coded cells to represent movement, exploration, and the final solution.
This project provides a practical understanding of recursion and state-space search in algorithm design.
It serves as an engaging educational tool to illustrate the concept of backtracking in DAA.
